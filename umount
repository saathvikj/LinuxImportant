If you cannot unmount a file system because "device is busy" and you are not in that directory, there is probably a process working in one of the subdirectories. You can see the process ID and owner of the offending program with the fuser command:
# umount /mnt
umount: /mnt: device is busy
umount: /mnt: device is busy
# fuser -mu /mnt
/mnt: 25781c(root)
# kill -9 25781
# umount /mnt

If you still cannot unmount the fs, or fuser hangs, try the "lazy" option to umount:
# umount -f -l /mnt
